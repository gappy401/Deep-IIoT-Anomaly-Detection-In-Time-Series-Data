# Project Overview and Folder Structure

This document explains the purpose of each folder in the project and provides guidance on how to set up and execute the project using the `requirements.txt` file.

## Folder Structure

### 1. `Notebooks/`
- Contains Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and prototyping.
- Key notebooks:
  - `EDA-Feature-Engineering.ipynb`: Handles preprocessing workflows for time series data.
  - Rest are individual model scripts for different types of models

### 2. `Resources/`
- Stores external references such as papers, tutorials, or diagrams.


### 3. `Gradient-Mechanism.md`
- A standalone markdown file detailing gradient compression strategies for federated learning.

### 4. `README.md`
- Provides an overview and abstract of the project.
- Links for model architecture and data used.
- Includes explanations about methodology, model architecture, and goals for anomaly detection in IIoT time series data.


### 5. `requirements.txt`
- Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project, ensuring reproducibility.
